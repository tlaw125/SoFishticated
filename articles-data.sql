<p class=Header>Do Research</p><p class=Info>While it is common for many
 people to think that fish are the easiest type of animal to keep as a pet, 
 they still need care and commitment just like any other pet. Every species of 
 fish is different and has different requirements that need to be met to ensure 
 they live long and happy lives. One of the most important steps to do when looking
 into starting up an aquarium is to actually look into the fish you are interested 
 in. Do research on the fish you are going to buy and make sure you can accommodate
 its needs, such as the maximum size it can reach, its temperament, preferred water
 temperature, etc. For example, you would not want to put a cold-water fish with a 
 tropical fish since tropical fish prefer warmer temperatures. Make sure the fish 
 being added to the tank will get along with your other fish and won't outgrow the
 tank itself when it gets older.</p></div><div class=regback><p class=Header>
 Cycling the Tank</p><p class=Info>Next thing to watch out for is what is 
 known as new tank syndrome. This occurs when a fish tank has just been set up and
 is not yet established enough to be able to handle fish. An established aquarium
 would have beneficial bacteria ready to convert ammonia to nitrite and then nitrate
 . This is called the <a class=refLink href=\"article.html?tag=nitrogen-cycle\">nitrogen cycle</a>.
 New tanks do not have these bacteria yet, so when fish are added into it, ammonia 
 quickly builds up to an extremely toxic level that can lead to death. New tank 
 syndrome can be prevented by preparing the tank or the filter that will clean the
 tank ahead of time. There are many ways to do this. One way, known as the fishless
 cycle, is to set up the aquarium and drop fish food in, and then leave the tank 
 running for about a month. The food will eventually release ammonia, which 
 encourages the growth of the beneficial bacteria. Another way is to jump start 
 the aquarium by adding beneficial bacteria yourself. This can be done by using 
 media from a tank that is already established or by buying aquarium products like
 Seachem stability and adding it into the tank water. Using this method is a lot 
 faster and you should be able to add fish in instantly, but make sure the monitor 
 ammonia levels with a test kit in case! 
 </p> </div><div class=darkback><p class=Header>Acclimating</p>
 <p class=Info>Before adding fish into an aquarium, make sure to acclimate 
 them before they are dropped in. Acclimating means to get the fish accustomed to
 the tank's temperature and other water parameters. The two main methods of 
 acclimating fish are the drip method and the plop-and-drop. The drip method is 
 highly recommended for sensitive fish and shrimp. You would pour the fish or
 shrimp into a bucket or container, use airline tubing to siphon water from the
 tank into the bucket, and tie a knot or two so that the water drips slowly into
 the bucket. This will slowly acclimate the fish/shrimp, preventing shock from a 
 sudden change in parameters. Once most of water in the bucket is from your tank,
 they should be ready to add in! Try not to get any water from the bucket into 
 your tank though, because the pet store or whatever tank your new fish had been 
 in before might have been carrying diseases, so it's best to play it safe and 
 not add any into your tank. The drop-and-plop method is highly recommended for
 fish that have been shipped and in a bag for a day or more. The reason for this 
 is because once the bag is opened, ammonia levels will surge and can do heavy 
 damage to your fish. The drop-and-plop method prevents this harm by adding the 
 fish into the tank once it is opened. First, temperature acclimate the fish by 
 floating the bag. Wait about 15 mins, and then have a bucket and net ready. 
 Open the bag and then quickly pour the fish into the net, letting the water 
 fall into the bucket. Then quickly add the fish into their new home!</p></div>
 <div class=regback><p class=Header>Maintenance</p><p class=Info>Once 
 the fish are in an established aquarium, it is important to maintain the levels 
 of nitrogen by doing water changes. Water changes are crucial to an aquarium's 
 overall health. High levels of nitrate encourage algae growth and can stress and
 even directly harm the fish, making them vulnerable to sickness. A weekly change
 of 25% is recommended to maintain water quality. Make sure to use dechlorinator 
 if you are getting water from the tap since chlorine will do serious damage to
 your fish. Also, try and match the temperature of the new water to the current 
 tank temperature to prevent your aquatic life from going into shock. When 
 cleaning the filter, make sure to rinse the media in old tank water to keep the
 beneficial bacteria living in it alive. </p></div>");

 "<div class=darkback><p class=Header>Tank</p><p class=Info>In simple
 terms, tanks are the containers that home your fish. So if you're new to 
 fishkeeping, make sure to do some research on what size tank to purchase based 
 on the type of fish you want to keep! A lot of media portrays the classic 
 goldfish in a small fish bowl. However, in reality this would be very bad for 
 the fish since goldfish will definitely outgrow a 0.5 gallon bowl and it is 
 difficult to find space in that tiny bowl for other necessary equipment to keep 
 the fish healthy. Another thing to keep in mind when getting a tank is the 
 material that it is made of. There are two main types: acrylic and glass.</p>
 <p class=Info>Acrylic aquariums are lighter and clearer than glass aquariums.
 Unfortunately, they are a lot easier to scratch than glass, but it is also a lot 
 easier to remove scratches from it compared to glass. Moneywise, acrylic is
 usually much more expensive and are generally only made for larger sized 
 aquariums about 40 gallons and up. </p></div>
 <div class=regback><p class=Header>Filter</p><p class=Info>Filters
 are an essential part to every aquarium. Not only do they keep the water clean,
 they also provide flow and oxygenation for the tank. Filters can provide up to 
 three types of filtration: mechanical, biological, and chemical. Mechanical 
 filtration deals with the physical unwanted solids within an aquarium such as 
 fish waste, uneaten food, and any other debris found floating in a tank. Common
 parts of the filter that deal with mechanical filtration are intake sponges and 
 filtration pads or filter floss. Biological filtration has to do with the maintaining 
 the  <a class=refLink href=\"article.html?tag=nitrogen-cycle\">nitrogen cycle</a>. Most of 
 the media in a filter is used to home the beneficial bacteria that convert the 
 toxic ammonia into nitrate that is safe for the fish and invertebrates in an 
 aquarium. Lastly, chemical filtration takes care of unwanted dissolved material 
 in a tank. It is not used as much as mechanical and biological filtration. The 
 most common media for chemical filtration is activated carbon, which keeps the 
 water looking clear and prevents it from smelling bad. </p></div>
 <div class=darkback><p class=Header>Heater</p><p class=Info>Heaters 
 keep the temperature of the water in your tank nice and warm. A heater is definitely
 a must-have when living in a cold area and keeping tropical fish since they are 
 used to and best kept in temperatures around 78F. Even if you live in a warm 
 environment already, it is nice to have one in the tank just in case it ever 
 gets too cool and to prevent drastic temperature swings that could stress the 
 livestock in the tank. </p></div>
 <div class=regback><p class=Header>Air Pump</p><p class=Info>Like most 
 living things on this planet, fish need oxygen to survive. In some cases, like 
 when the filter is not providing enough water surface movement and aeration for
 the tank, an air pump is necessary to help oxygenate the water. Plants also need
 oxygen at night, so heavily planted CO2 tank owners should consider having an 
 air pump ready to go if they ever see fish struggling to breathe. A lot of
 people accompany an air pump with an air stone, so the bubbles are smaller, 
 making it easier to dissolve into the water and quieter when reaching the 
 surface. Air pumps also add more water circulation into the aquarium. </p></div>
 <div class=darkback><p class=Header>Powerhead</p><p class=Info>The
 main purpose for powerheads is to add more flow and water movement into the 
 aquarium. Larger sized aquariums tend to have areas where there is no or very 
 little flow, so fish waste and other debris will collect there instead of 
 getting filtered. Powerheads can solve this problem and provide a more natural 
 environment for fish that are used to living with a current. </p></div>
 <div class=regback><p class=Header>Light</p><p class=Info>In order to 
 see your tank clearly in all its beauty, a nice light is needed. Especially in 
 a planted tank with plants that need high light, a strong full spectrum light 
 is recommended. It is better to have the aquarium with its own light placed away
 from windows where direct sunlight can hit it so that the lighting can be 
 controlled to prevent algae from blooming and covering everything in the tank.

 "<p class=Info>Many of us will remember hearing the word nitrogen from school.
 Nitrogen is a chemical element, and is about 78% of the atmosphere. Existing 
 in such high amounts surely means that this element is really important, and it
 is! A majority of living animals use nitrogen for many bodily processes, and as 
 a result, will release nitrogen in different forms, such as ammonia, nitrite, 
 and nitrate. In high concentrations, these compounds are toxic, ammonia being 
 the most toxic and nitrate being the least. To fully understand how nitrogen 
 flows through a system, we will have to take a look at the nitrogen cycle.</p> 
 <p class=Info>The nitrogen cycle is similar for both in and out of water. Since
 this is a fishkeeping site, we will focus on how nitrogen flows through an 
 aquatic animal and in an aquatic ecosystem. Nitrogen is a byproduct of protein
 breakdown. Therefore, fish waste, uneaten food, decaying plants, and any other 
 decomposing matter produce ammonia. This ammonia is then turned into nitrite, 
 and then the nitrite is turned in nitrate by beneficial bacteria. </p> 
 <p class=Info>Typically, in a natural environment with a large amount of water,
 ammonia is quickly diluted and does not harm the fish in any way. In an aquarium,
 the ammonia can build up easily and create a toxic living environment for the 
 fish. In a cycled aquarium, ammonia is quickly converted to nitrite by bacteria 
 that live mostly in the media of the tank filter. Nitrite is less toxic than 
 ammonia, but will still cause harm in high concentrations. The nitrite in the 
 tank will be converted to nitrate, by other bacteria species that also reside 
 within the media of the tank filter. Nitrate is the safest form of nitrogen for 
 fish, and can be tolerated at higher amounts. The nitrate in the tank must still
 be removed from the tank and there are several ways to do so. Aquatic plants 
 can absorb and use nitrates to grow, so having aquatic plants will help lower 
 nitrate levels. The best way to remove all forms of nitrogen from a tank is to
 do water changes, so keep up those water changes! </p>");

"<p class=Info>If you like gardening, but don't like going outside and getting 
attacked by bugs, then you should try growing aquatic plants in the comfort of 
your home! Aquatic plants can easily be grown in tanks with or without fish. 
More info on the benefits of a planted tank can be found 
<a class=refLink href=\"article.html?tag=plant-benefits\">here</a>. A huge 
variety of aquatic plants exist for you to explore! </p>
<p class=Info>Before you purchase any aquatic plants, there are some factors that
 should be considered. Light is very important for plants to grow big and strong.
 Plants can be separated into low, medium, or high light plants. Buy an 
 appropriate light fixture and bulb based on which type of aquatic plants you 
 choose to grow. Substrate is another factor to keep in mind, since some 
 substrates will release fertilizers while others will not. Purchasing the 
 correct substrate will help you maintain a balanced tank and avoid algae blooms. 
 Speaking of fertilizers, there are liquid forms that can be purchased and added 
 into the tank. Adding nutrients correctly will promote growth and color. All 
 plants need carbon dioxide(CO2) to grow, but there is much less CO2 in water 
 than there is in the air. As a result, adding CO2 to the tank by liquid or gas 
 will promote the best growth. Each aquatic plant will have their own specific 
 needs to grow its best. 
 Our <a class=refLink href=\"plant-list.html?sortBy=name&numVals=10&firstVal=0\">aquatic plant fact sheets</a>
 should be able to help you learn what conditions need to be met for each plant to
 thrive in. </p>
 <p class=Info>Aquatic plants will rarely have flowers. You may be thinking no 
 flowers means no seeds, so how do I get more plants? Aquatic plants spread by 
 two ways, through divisions or runners. Some plants can be divided or trimmed 
 to make one plant into two plants. Trimming and pruning plants help them thrive
 because it encourages healthy growth. When the divided plants grow to a good 
 size again, they can be divided another time. The second way some aquatic plants
 propagate is by sending out runners. When these plants are mature, they will 
 send out runners, which are similar to stems, under the substrate. From these 
 stems, new baby plants will grow. Large mature plants are often seen being 
 called mother plants, since they will produce a lot of runners or can be divided
 to make many new plantlets. Slowly you will end up with so many plants you won't
 know what to do with them! </p>

"<p class=Summary>Aquatic plants can be incredibly beneficial to your tank! In 
addition to aesthetics, aquatic plants assist in improving fish health and 
overall water quality. </p>
<div class=darkback><p class=Header>Improves Water Quality</p>
<p class=Info>Similar to most respiring organisms, fish need Oxygen. Fish acquire
 dissolved Oxygen from the water using their gills and subsequently release CO2 
 into the water similar to how we inhale and exhale. Over time, the level of CO2 
 in the water increases while the level of O2 decreases. Low Oxygen levels can 
 eventually lead to the suffocation and death of your fish. One way to alleviate 
 high CO2 levels is through the use of aquatic plants. A majority of aquatic 
 plants go through photosynthesis, which is the process most plants use to acquire
 their food. Photosynthesis involves absorbing Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and releasing
 Oxygen (O2) which means that the aquatic plants will essentially absorb the CO2 
 in the water and replace it with O2. Over time, the aquatic plants can help 
 aerate and saturate the aquarium water with O2. Additionally, aquatic plants can
 further help improve water quality by acting as a filter. For example, aquatic 
 plants can absorb Ammonia (from fish waste, which can become toxic if left to 
 build up over time) and filter it out of the water via their Xylem transport 
 (moves water and nutrients from their roots to their leaves) which the plant 
 will use as a food source. Despite their ability to filter water, it should be 
 noted that aquatic plants can't fully replace actual mechanical filters, they 
 simply assist in improving water quality. </p></div>
 <div class=regback><p class=Header>Reduces Algae</p>
 <p class=Info>In addition to improving water quality, some aquatic plants can 
 also help reduce algae growth! Certain aquatic plants can actually compete with
 algae for resources, hindering the algae's ability to grow rapidly and abundantly.
 This does not, however, reduce the need for water changes. Furthermore, aquatic 
 plants can also help stabilize substrate. </p></div>
 <div class=darkback><p class=Header>Helps Fish Out</p>
 <p class=Info>Aquatic plants can also improve both the mental and physical
 health of your fish. In regards to physical health, aquatic plants can provide
 security and shelter for your fish. The security that aquatic plants can provide
 is especially vital if your tank contains a variety of fish with some being more
 territorial or aggressive than others. The aquatic plants can help protect or 
 separate your aggressive fish from your non-aggressive fish and overall, allow 
 the different species of fish to coexist together. Furthermore, the addition of 
 aquatic plants can also help promote breeding amongst your fish. In regards to
 mental health, the addition of aquatic plants to your tank can help replicate 
 the natural ecosystem or habitat in which the fish live in. This is essential 
 to the health of your fish as it provides a variety of psychological benefits 
 such as reducing the amount of stress your fish may feel when placed into a new
 environment. Having high levels of stress can make your fish more susceptible to
 various diseases. Therefore, it's important to help lower stress levels which 
 aquatic plants do by making the fish feel more comfortable. Think about it like 
 this: normally, you would feel comfortable or carefree in your own home, but 
 let's assume that one day you were forced to move far away to a new home on a 
 different continent where everything is different from the life you once knew. 
 How would you feel? Probably stressed out and not very comfortable! This is 
 similar to how your fish might feel, so it's important that we replicate their 
 natural environment to the best of our ability which is an important thing to do
 when moving any animal out of its natural habitat into an artificial one 
 (Note: it's important to choose aquatic plants which are appropriate for the 
 water and fish species in your tank). In short, the point of having a fish tank 
 isn't to create a prison for your fish, but to create a home for your new family
 member to live in. </p></div>
